# Intent Classification Annotation Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project contains a manually annotated intent classification dataset created for NLP and chatbot training practice.

The dataset includes text samples labeled across multiple intent categories with confidence scores.

## 🎯 Objective

The purpose of this project is to:

- Practice supervised intent classification
- Detect user intents accurately (Information Request, Complaint, Feedback, Purchase Intent, Threat, Greeting, Spam)
- Handle ambiguous intent cases
- Build portfolio-ready NLP annotation experience

## 🗂 Dataset Information
