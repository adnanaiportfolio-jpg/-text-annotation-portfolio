# Text Moderation Annotation Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project contains a manually annotated text moderation dataset for NLP and content filtering practice.

The dataset includes text samples labeled across multiple moderation categories with confidence scores.

## 🎯 Objective

The purpose of this project is to:

- Practice supervised content moderation classification
- Detect unsafe, spam, abusive, violent, hate speech, and sarcastic content
- Handle ambiguous moderation cases
- Build portfolio-ready AI and data annotation experience

## 🗂 Dataset Information
