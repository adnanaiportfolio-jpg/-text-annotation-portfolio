# Named Entity Recognition (NER) Annotation Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project contains a manually annotated Named Entity Recognition (NER) dataset created for NLP and information extraction practice.

The dataset includes text samples labeled with entity types such as Person, Organization, Location, Date & Time, Money, Product, and Event.

## 🎯 Objective

The purpose of this project is to:

- Practice supervised NER annotation  
- Identify entities in text accurately  
- Handle overlapping and ambiguous entity cases  
- Build portfolio-ready NLP and AI annotation experience  

## 🗂 Dataset Information

Total Samples: 50  
Annotation Type: Named Entity Recognition (NER)  

Each entry contains:

- ID  
- TEXT  
- ENTITY  
- LABEL  
- CONFIDENCE_SCORE  
- COMMENT (only for ambiguous cases)

## 🏷 Entity Categories Used

- Person  
- Organization  
- Location  
- Date & Time  
- Money  
- Product  
- Event  

## 📊 Annotation Approach

- Entities were labeled directly from the text according to their type.  
- Clear mentions were labeled with high confidence.  
- Ambiguous or multi-entity texts include explanatory comments.  

## 🚀 Possible Use Cases

- Information extraction from documents  
- NLP model training for entity recognition  
- Chatbot understanding and automation  
- Knowledge graph construction  

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Google Sheets (Data Annotation)  
- CSV format for structured dataset  
- GitHub for project hosting
